Number of iterations

Percentage of checks passed

Median HTTP request duration

HTTP requests failed

 Number of iterationsThis metric is labeled iterations and shows the total number of times the test script's main function was completed during the test run

Percentage of checks passedThe checks metric reports the overall success rate of your test script's check() assertions. A single check, such as check(res, { 'is status 200': (r) => r.status === 200 }), will contribute to this metric. It is often represented as a percentage rate (e.g., rate=100.00%). Median HTTP request durationThis can be found under the http_req_duration metric. The duration metric is a Trend type and reports several statistics, including the median (med), which shows the value at which 50% of requests were faster and 50% were slower. HTTP requests failedThe http_req_failed metric shows the percentage of HTTP requests that failed. A request is typically considered a failure if it results in a non-2xx status code. This is a Rate type metric, with a value from 0 to 1, where 1.00 represents 100% failure and 0.00 represents 0% failure.
